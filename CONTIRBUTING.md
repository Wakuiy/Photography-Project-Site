How to Contribute
=================

I'm really glad you're reading this, because we love taking contributions from people like you, who use and love Vlad like we do. 

If you haven't already, please take a look at the [Vlad documentation][vlad-docs]. We could use your help there too if you have the time. 

Issues
------

If you find a bug or want to improve Vlad in some way then open up an [issue][issues].

The `dev` branch contains the latest development code, so please test your bug or improvement there first to see if it has already been fixed, before you take the time to investigate it yourself.

Pull Requests
-------------

Pull requests to the project are welcome but **should not** be done to the `master` branch. All pull requests **must** be created against the `dev` branch. 

Tests
-----

In order to ensure that things run correctly all software installed should have at least one test.
